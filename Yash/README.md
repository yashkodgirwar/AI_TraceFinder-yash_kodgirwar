ðŸ“Œ AI TraceFinder â€“ Progress Report (Yash Kodgirwar)
ðŸ”¹ Work Completed

âœ… Dataset collected and preprocessed

âœ… Baseline feature extraction with pixel intensity flattening

âœ… Trained models:-Pixel Intensity Baseline (XGBoost, RF, SVM)

SVM â€“ Accuracy: 79%

Random Forest â€“ Accuracy: 89%

XGBoost â€“ Accuracy: 97% (saved model + label encoder)

âœ… Confusion matrices and classification reports generated

Handcrafted Features ( FFT + LBP + PRNU + correlation):

SVM â†’ ~72%
Random Forest â†’ ~71%
XGBoost  â†’ ~74%

Hybrid CNN (Residual Images + Handcrafted Features):

Achieved ~74.7% test accuracy
Models saved (scanner_hybrid.keras, scanner_hybrid_final.keras)



ðŸ”¹ Next Steps:-
Implement Hybrid CNN + handcrafted features.

Finalize comparison table:
