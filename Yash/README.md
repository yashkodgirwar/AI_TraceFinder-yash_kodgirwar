ðŸ“Œ AI TraceFinder â€“ Progress Report (Yash Kodgirwar)
ðŸ”¹ Work Completed

âœ… Dataset collected and preprocessed

âœ… Baseline feature extraction with pixel intensity flattening

âœ… Trained models:-Pixel Intensity Baseline (XGBoost, RF, SVM)

SVM â€“ Accuracy: 79%

Random Forest â€“ Accuracy: 89%

XGBoost â€“ Accuracy: 97% (saved model + label encoder)

âœ… Confusion matrices and classification reports generated

ðŸ”¹ Work in Progress

ðŸš§ CNN model training (baseline CNN with image inputs)

ðŸš§ Hybrid CNN (CNN + handcrafted features like FFT, LBP, PRNU)

ðŸš§ Organizing results into results/ folder

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps

Train & evaluate CNN model, compare with traditional ML.

Implement Hybrid CNN + handcrafted features.

Finalize comparison table:
